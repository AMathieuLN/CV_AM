::: {#absA3 .collapse .abstract-block .mt-2}
This article examines the challenges and opportunities for implementing Green Jobs (GJs) in developing economies. A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of 516 scientific articles reveals a tension between short-term economic aspirations and long-term sustainable goals. The objective is to identify the conditions under which green jobs can effectively contribute to sustainable development in these economies. In the current context marked by multiple shocks, the concept of green jobs is perceived as a potential response to crises. However, debates about its definition persist, particularly in developing economies that are often overlooked and that question both the “green” and “jobs” components of GJs. The pervasive informal sector presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The success of this transition depends on substantial investments in human capital and a long-term vision integrating economic and sustainability objectives. Emerging small-scale technologies offer new transformative opportunities. The article concludes by highlighting the underrepresentation of developing economies in the English-language green-jobs literature and calls for a more inclusive scientific approach.

This article presents a bibliometric dataset dedicated to the study of green jobs, compiling 414 scientific articles from Scopus and Web of Science following the PRISMA protocol (1995–2022). The dataset captures key bibliometric dimensions-authors, keywords, citations, conceptual clusters—and provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing the structure and evolution of the green-jobs research field. It enables comparative work with institutional and media discourses on ecological transition and can be expanded to include additional forms of literature (books, chapters, conference papers), making it suitable for multilingual and multidisciplinary analyses. The dataset is intended as an open resource for researchers, institutions and policymakers working on labour markets, sustainability transitions and environmental governance.

::: {#absA1 .collapse .abstract-block .mt-2}
This paper examines COVID-19 policies implemented by small island economies (SIEs), focusing on differences between SIEs and non-SIEs, and between affiliated and independent SIEs. Using a unified dataset of 84 SIEs, the article analyzes the measures adopted and their implementation timelines. Results show that SIEs acted earlier than non-SIEs, with no major distinction between affiliated and independent islands. Insularity is associated with faster public-health responses, while political status shows limited influence on timing.

Chapter presenting the SIECRT dataset, which documents eight health measures taken by 26 small island economies between 2020 and 2021. It shows that insularity promotes a strong capacity for anticipation-with SIDS adopting their first measures before cases appeared-while political status has a marginal influence on timing and policy choices. The analysis highlights the role of open science in building reliable comparative data and the need to adapt health policies to the structural specificities of SIDS.

While the concept of ‘green’ jobs is gaining ground, its macroeconomic effects remain poorly studied, particularly in economies with high levels of informality. This study assesses the impact of jobs with high greening potential (HGPJ) on growth, resilience to cyclical downturns and intergenerational sustainability (adjusted real savings). Using a panel covering economies in the North and South, we combine fixed effects models and two-stage IV estimation using a synthetic geographical instrument (geo_index) to identify the causal effect of the share of GPJ. The results reveal a causal growth dividend: an exogenous increase in HGPJ stimulates GDP and mitigates both the frequency and depth of prolonged downturns. Informality, as measured by the self-employment rate, does not significantly alter these effects. With regard to sustainability, quadratic estimates show a U-shaped relationship: below a threshold of 30–35% of EFPV, transition costs reduce net savings, while above this threshold there appears to be a real green benefit. These results shed light on the institutional and social conditions necessary to transform the greening of employment into a sustainable driver of growth and resilience.

::: {#absWP2 .collapse .abstract-block .mt-2}
Current measures of job greening remain focused on the formal economies of the North, neglecting the massive informality of the economies of the South. This working paper proposes a new global mapping of activities with high greening potential. By cross-referencing NACE–ISIC with the European Green Taxonomy, we have constructed SAGE, a harmonised database derived from ILOSTAT microdata, disaggregated by gender, age, education, establishment size and formal/informal status. We introduce the concept of jobs with high greening potential (JHP), which is better suited to the contexts covered by SAGE than the category of 'green jobs'. Our results show a clear gradient: high-income countries have a higher concentration of HGPJ, while low-income economies lag behind and remain highly heterogeneous. Higher education graduates have much greater access to HGPJ, while young people and informal workers are largely excluded. Sectorally, water, waste and renewable energy services dominate in advanced countries, compared to agriculture and extraction in Southern economies. These results highlight the need to adapt greening measurement frameworks to informal economies in order to support a truly inclusive transition.

## Towards an equitable and open North-South research community / Vers une communauté de recherche équitable et ouverte Nords-Suds (CREONS)
CREONS is a research programme under development that examines structural inequalities in research funding and the conditions for more equitable and open science between the Global North and South. It combines three areas of work:

1. Documenting research inequalities in French-speaking Africa using previously unpublished data;
2. Co-developing open science and AI tools;
3. Defining equitable decarbonisation of research using a tool that combines carbon footprint and scientific benefits.

Led by a transdisciplinary team of economists, geographers, sociologists and philosophers, CREONS is part of a political economy of science and a just transition in research, articulating epistemic, distributive and environmental justice.

## Working Group on Doctoral Disparities and Inequalities / Groupe de travail sur les Disparités et Inégalités Doctorales ([GTDID](https://umisource.github.io/GTDID/en/))
Website: [https://umisource.github.io/GTDID/en/](https://umisource.github.io/GTDID/en/)

In collaboration with doctoral students, researchers and research support staff, I took part in the formation of the GTDID, focusing on inequalities in doctoral research between North and South regions. We are conducting an analysis of doctoral conditions, highlighting the challenges of cultural and academic diversity, and carrying out an exhaustive review of the literature on doctoral disparities between North and South. The study focuses on the causes of these inequalities, such as funding, access to resources and working conditions, and their impact on developing research. A groundbreaking comparative empirical study is being organized, using mixed methods. This group is part of the IRD Working Group on Inequalities, with the participation of researchers and doctoral students.

## POLICIES and Institutions in small island economies (SIE) for better resilience in response to the COVID crisis (POLIR)

Directed by V. Geronimi for UMI SOURCE (ex-CEMOTEV) (France), LARJE (New Caledonia), CERDI (France), LC2S (Martinique), CEMOI (Réunion), ATOM (Guadeloupe), Massey University (New Zealand), LAVUE (Mayotte), PRINTEMPS (France). The POLIR project aims to analyse the role of policies and institutions in the socio-economic resilience of SIE in the face of the COVID 19 pandemic. The project thus aims to assess the capacity of SIE to regain, renew or reinvent their economic activities, depending on policies, institutions and development models in the face of the pandemic.

I took part in this program as part of my M2 internship, which resulted in several scientific productions:
