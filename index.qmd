## **Postdoctoral researcher**

I hold a **PhD in Economics** from **Paris-Saclay University** and am currently a **postdoctoral researcher in political economics** at the Joint International Unit for Sustainability and Resilience – **SOURCE** (Paris-Saclay University, UVSQ, IRD). My research focuses on two sectors of the **labour market**: on the one hand, **green jobs**, which I study from a political economy perspective of development and figures, in relation to informality and just transitions in the economies of the Global South; on the other hand, **scientific work**, which I analyse through a political economy of science that focuses on scientific sovereignty, open science and inequalities in knowledge production.

I use quantitative, qualitative and bibliometric methods, as well as open data sets, to analyse employment and sustainability dynamics, while placing my work within a broader reflection on the conditions for a more equitable and open sustainable transition between the Global North and South.
