## **PhD Student**

I am a third-year **doctoral student** at the International Mixed Unit for Sustainability and Resilience ([UMI SOURCE](https://www.umi-source.uvsq.fr/)), affiliated with the University of Paris-Saclay ([UPSaclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)), the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines ([UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/english)), and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development ([IRD](https://en.ird.fr/)).

My thesis examines the **role of green jobs in the sustainability and resilient development of marginalized economies**, within the Doctoral School of Law, Economics, Management ([DEM](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/ecoles-doctorales/droit-economie-management-dem)) at the University of Paris-Saclay.

As a referent for a **working group on doctoral inequalities**, I also analyze disparities between doctoral conditions in the North and South. Additionally, I have studying the **resilience of small island economies** in the face of a pandemic shock such as the Covid-19 crisis.

Finally, my work is firmly rooted in an **open science approach**. I use the tools promoted by open science, and that allowed me to offer an initial training session in Abidjan in April 2024. I take a reflective approach to these tools and, together with my colleagues, I participate in discussions on their potential as a response to **international research inequalities**.
