Foundations and conditions of green jobs in developing economies: Systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis.\nDevelopment and Sustainability in Economics and Finance, 100016.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsef.2024.100016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article examines the challenges and opportunities for implementing Green Jobs (GJs) in developing economies. A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of 516 scientific articles reveals a tension between short-term economic aspirations and long-term sustainable goals. The objective is to identify the conditions under which green jobs can effectively contribute to sustainable development in these economies. In the current context marked by multiple shocks, the concept of green jobs is perceived as a potential response to crises. However, debates about its definition persist, particularly in developing economies that are often overlooked and that question both the “green” and “jobs” components of GJs. The pervasive informal sector in these economies presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the green transition. The success of this transition is contingent upon substantial investments in human capital, as well as a long-term vision that harmoniously integrates economic and sustainability considerations. Emerging small-scale technologies appear as transformative opportunities, especially in these contexts. However, for green jobs to be genuinely effective, they must be supported by a robust economic and legislative framework. The study concludes by emphasizing the underrepresentation of developing economies in the English-language literature on green jobs, underscoring the need for a more inclusive approach.\n\n\n\n[2] Mathieu, A.

We have crafted a bibliometric dataset centered on this concept, amassing 414 articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, following a laid down protocol, PRISMA, spanning the period from 1995 to 2022. This endeavor aims to depict the dynamics, themes, and conceptual approaches shaping the discourse on green jobs. The dataset, structured around 13 descriptive variables such as authors, keywords, and cited references, is made available to researchers, institutions, and decision-makers to provide insight into the academic debates on ecological transition through the lens of employment, especially in the wake of a green economy. The potential for reutilizing these data is expansive. They can serve as a foundation for comparative analyses with the media and institutional portrayals of green jobs. Furthermore, the dataset can be enriched by integrating other forms of literature, such as books, chapters, or conference proceedings, while retaining the existing structure. This expansibility paves the way for a multidisciplinary and multilingual exploration, thereby enhancing the richness and diversity of possible analyses.\n\n\n\n[1] Mathieu, A. Taranco, A. (2023).

    "text": "Working Group on Doctoral Disparities and Inequalities / Groupe de travail sur les Disparités et Inégalités Doctorales (GTDID)\nIn collaboration with doctoral students, researchers and research support staff, I took part in the formation of the GTDID, focusing on inequalities in doctoral research between North and South regions. We are conducting an analysis of doctoral conditions, highlighting the challenges of cultural and academic diversity, and carrying out an exhaustive review of the literature on doctoral disparities between North and South. The study focuses on the causes of these inequalities, such as funding, access to resources and working conditions, and their impact on developing research. A groundbreaking comparative empirical study is being organized, using mixed methods. This group is part of the IRD Working Group on Inequalities, with the participation of researchers and doctoral students.\nFirst productions:\n\nMathieu, A. Rihi, Y. Massera, M. Moing, L.

The POLIR project aims to analyse the role of policies and institutions in the socio-economic resilience of SIE in the face of the COVID 19 pandemic. The project thus aims to assess the capacity of SIE to regain, renew or reinvent their economic activities, depending on policies, institutions and development models in the face of the pandemic.\nI took part in this program as part of my M2 internship, which resulted in several scientific productions:\n\nMathieu, A.

Unique in its kind, it focuses on affiliated (or non-independent) island economies, usually overlooked in other databases, and includes eight daily-coded public health measures, such as restrictions on gatherings, educational establishments and international travel."
